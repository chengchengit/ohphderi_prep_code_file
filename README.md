The pdf file "Spheroidal harmonic expressions for the derivatives of the gravitational potential" is the work that discusses the oblate and prolate spheroidal harmonic expressions for the derivatives of the gravitational potential up to third-order with singular and non-singular forms.

The data files provided in the folder "OH and SH Coefficients" include the following four .tab files:
(i)   prism_aab.tab file, the shape model file of the uniform prism
(ii)  Prism_mass.tab file, the mass of the uniform prism (in kg)
(iii) Prism_OHCoef_NMAX180.tab file, the oblate spheroidal harmonic coefficients of the gravitational potential of the uniform prism up to d/o 180
(iv)  Prism_SHCoef_NMAX180.tab file, the spherical harmonic coefficients of the gravitational potential of the uniform prism up to d/o 180

The data files provided in the folder "PH and SH Coefficients" include the following four .tab files:
